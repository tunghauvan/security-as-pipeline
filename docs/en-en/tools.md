## Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools

### Purpose

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to analyze the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. These tools can help developers and security professionals identify and fix security issues early in the development process, reducing the risk of security breaches and data leaks.

### Example Usage
- Use Checkmarx to scan the source code of a web application for common security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Integrate Veracode into the CI/CD pipeline to perform automated security scans of the application code during the build process.
- Analyze the results of a Fortify scan to identify potential security weaknesses in a mobile application developed for iOS and Android platforms.
