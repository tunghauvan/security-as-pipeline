# SAST Engine

**Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** is a type of security testing that is performed without executing the code. It is a white-box testing method that analyzes the source code or compiled version of an application for security vulnerabilities. SAST tools scan the code for known security flaws, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting, and provide detailed reports on the identified issues.

### Notes

#### Checkmarx vs SonarQube Comparison

Checkmarx and SonarQube are both popular tools for static code analysis, but they have different focuses and features. Here's a comparison:

##### Checkmarx (Commercial)

- Primarily a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool
- Focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities in your code
- Supports a wide range of programming languages
- Offers deep and accurate analysis with fewer false positives
- Provides detailed vulnerability reports and remediation guidance
- Integrates with many IDEs and CI/CD tools
- Commercial product with professional support

##### SonarQube (Open-Source and Commercial)

- Platform for continuous inspection of code quality
- Checks for code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities
- Supports more than 20 programming languages
- Offers both an open-source version and commercial versions (Developer, Enterprise, and Data Center editions)
- Commercial versions provide additional features like security reports, project management, and portfolio management
- Integrates with many IDEs and CI/CD tools
- Provides a user-friendly interface with a detailed dashboard
- Widely used with a large community for support and resources

In summary, if your primary concern is security, Checkmarx might be the better choice due to its focus on security vulnerabilities. If you're more concerned with general code quality and prefer an open-source tool, SonarQube might be a better fit. However, both tools are capable of identifying security issues in your code.
