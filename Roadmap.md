# :construction: Road map to learn deep about SecOps :construction:

## Introduction
SecOps, short for Security Operations, is a practice that combines security and operations to ensure the protection and integrity of an organization's systems and data. It involves integrating security practices into the development and deployment processes, enabling organizations to identify and respond to security threats effectively.

In today's digital landscape, where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, SecOps plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information, preventing data breaches, and maintaining the overall security posture of an organization.

This roadmap aims to provide a comprehensive guide for individuals interested in learning more about SecOps. It covers various aspects, including security principles, threat modeling, vulnerability management, incident response, and more.
